## Semester

[IBC21] InnoBootCamp 2021 (August 2021)

## Description

The course briefly reviews various concepts of Computer Science, including the basic programming skills, algorithms
design and complexity analysis, the elements of combinatorics, performance evaluation of programs (runtime and memory
consumption), the discussion of the key differences between modern programming languages, such as C/C++, Java, and
Python. We especially focus on recursive and iterative algorithms. Finally, we conclude the course with a brief
introduction to probability and statistics laws.
