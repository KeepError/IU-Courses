# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Semester

[S22] Spring 2022 (January - May 2022)

## Description

This course provides an intensive treatment of a cross-section of the key elements of algorithms and datastructures, with an emphasis on implementing them in modern programming environments, and using them to
solve real-world problems. The course will begin with the fundamentals of searching, sorting, lists, stacks, and
queues, but will quickly build to cover more advanced topics, including trees, graphs, and algorithmic strategies.
It will also cover the analysis of the performance and tractability of algorithms and will build on the concept of
Abstract Data Types. A key focus of the course is on effective implementation and good design principles.
